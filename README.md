# App Container Specifications

To provide a clear governance of the App Container spec, it is important that the spec
remains independent of the implementation.

This repository ~~can serve as an independent master of just the specifications~~
will mirror the specifications until more implementations have been developed.


You can view the latest version of the mirrored [App Container Spec](SPEC.md), or the official one on the [CoreOS/rocket repository](https://github.com/coreos/rocket/blob/master/app-container/SPEC.md).

Please reference [this github issue](https://github.com/coreos/rocket/issues/139#issuecomment-65499147) for more rationaile behind why the spec is in the Rocket repository.

## Implementations
